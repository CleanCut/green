Features
--------

- **Clean** - Low redundancy in output. Result statistics for each test is vertically aligned.
- **Colorful** - Terminal output makes good use of color when the terminal supports it.
- **Fast** - Tests run in independent processes.  (One per processor by default.  Does not play nicely with gevent.)
- **Powerful** - Multi-target + auto-discovery.
- **Traditional** - Use the normal ``unittest`` classes and methods for your unit tests.
- **Descriptive** - Multiple verbosity levels, from just dots to full docstring output.
- **Convenient** - Bash-completion and ZSH-completion of options and test targets.
- **Thorough** - Built-in integration with `coverage`_
- **Modern** - Supports Python 3.5+.  Additionally, `PyPy` is supported on a best-effort basis.
- **Portable** - macOS, Linux, and BSDs are fully supported.  Windows is supported on a best-effort basis.
- **Living** - This project grows and changes.  See the `changelog`_
